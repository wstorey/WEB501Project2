## Notice
By competing you are agreeing to our liability terms which state you are at fault for your injuries. Due to the sharp and dirty surface of Cooper's Hill, there are usually a thousand of injuries each year. A first aid service is provided by the local St John Ambulance (Gloucester, Cheltenham and Stroud Divisions) at the bottom of the hill. Members of the local rugby club and Young Farmers volunteer their services by acting as 'catchers' for any participants who lose their balance and also are on hand to carry down any casualties requiring first aid who do not reach the bottom. A number of ambulance vehicles attend the event, since there is invariably at least one and often several injuries requiring hospital treatment. Please do your best to not injure other contestants. If you lose control rolling down the hill, well, just go with it.
