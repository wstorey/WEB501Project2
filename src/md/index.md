The Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake is an annual event held on the Spring Bank Holiday at Cooper's Hill, near Gloucester in England. It was traditionally held by and for the people who live in the local village of Brockworth, Gloucestershire, but now people from all over the world take part. The Guardian newspaper called it a "world-famous event", with winners coming from the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Nepal.  The event is traditional and takes its name from the steep hill on which it occurs. Until recent years, it was managed in a quasi-official manner by nominated locals, but since 2010 the event has taken place spontaneously without any management. 

The premise is simple - chase after a wheel of authentic Double Gloucester cheese down a rather steep hill. Should you catch the cheese, it's yours to do with as you please! This year's event will be held on __May 25, 2020__ so please arrive early and get ready for some fun and potential injuries! There will be something for everyone. High stakes, action, laughter, cheese. Please join us for this year's wonderful time!
